# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of the project was to assist Maria, to analyze standardized test data and other school information for a school district to gather insights and trends. To perform the analysis we had datasets relating to the school funding standardized test scores. These data sets were used to show school performance. Based on the analysis and key metrics discovered, stakeholders will make decisions for school spending and budgets in the district. After initial analysis, it was found that “Thomas High School,” which was one of the schools in the data set had grades altered for the 9th graders. As a result, stakeholders wanted the metrics to be recalculated by excluding the standardized test scores for math and reading for “Thomas High School.” The metrics calculated earlier were updated and this report summarizes how the exclusion of data from this school mentioned above affected the overall analysis. 

## Results

After excluding math and reading scores for “Thomas High School” and recalculating our metrics the following effects of the above-mentioned changes were found in our analysis: 

### Affect on the district summary:

In our district summary analysis, we can see that the exclusion of the data only resulted in minor changes for the percentage of students passing Math, Reading, and the    overall figure. As we can see the overall percentage went down from 65.17% to 64.9%.


### Affect on School Summary:

From our images, we can see that exclusion of the data had a far greater impact on this data. The percentage passing for math went down to 66.9% from 93.2%. The same can be seen for reading percentages. The overall percentage also dropped to 65.07% from 90.9%. This indicates that 9th graders in particular for Thomas High School had a lot of students earlier who passed the standardized tests.  



### Replacing 9th graders math and reading scores and effect on Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools: 

Before replacing the data for 9th graders for Thomas High School, Thomas high school was the second-best performing school in the district. Also, after the exclusion of data for 9th graders, Thomas High School was ranked 2nd among the 15 schools in the district. 

### Affect on Math and Reading Scores by Grade:

After removing all the math and reading scores for Thomas High School, there were no values for math and average reading scores by grade. 

### Scores by school spending size:
